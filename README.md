## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Fast development environment
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/0) - Extensible form library

### What I learned

I learned how to use react-hook-form for building forms and provide easy validation.

Also utilized CSS Modules to the best of my abilities for encapsulation of CSS styles. Although please feel free to provide any feedback on my frontendmentor profile, it's my first time using CSS Modules. Vite.js really streamlines this process because [it supports Modules out of the box](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-modules).

I'm still getting a grasp of media queries to implement responsive design.

I was somewhat learned on React.js before this project, however it always amazes me its flexibility. Keeping the card component in sync with the form inputs was fairly straightforward thanks to React.

### Useful resources

I always make sure to check documentation:

- [react-hook-form API](https://react-hook-form.com/docs)
- [CSS Modules docs](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [React.js Learn](https://react.dev/learn)

Also this is an useful series of articles for dipping your toes in CSS Modules:
